# Represents a message sent from one user to one or more others.
# 
# == States
# 
# Messages can be in 1 of 3 states:
# * +unsent+ - The message has not yet been sent.  This is the *initial* state.
# * +queued+ - The message has been queued for future delivery.
# * +sent+ - The message has been sent.
# 
# == Interacting with the message
# 
# In order to perform actions on the message, such as queueing or delivering,
# you should always use the associated event action:
# * +queue+ - Queues the message so that you can send it in a separate process
# * +deliver+ - Sends the message to all of the recipients
# 
# == Message visibility
# 
# Although you can delete a message, it will also delete it from the inbox of all
# the message's recipients.  Instead, you can change the *visibility* of the
# message.  Messages have 1 of 2 states that define its visibility:
# * +visible+ - The message is visible to the sender
# * +hidden+ - The message is hidden from the sender
# 
# The visibility of a message can be changed by running the associated action:
# * +hide+ -Hides the message from the sender
# * +unhide+ - Makes the message visible again
